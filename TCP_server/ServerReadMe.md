This is the process followed to make a bare bones TCP server application on linux 

General process to follow:

//Create a socket
//Bind the socket to an IP port
//Bind the socket for listening 
//Accept a call
//Close the listening socket

// Logic for what the server does:
                        simply prints the received message and echos it back to the client
